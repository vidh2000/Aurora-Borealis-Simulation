# Aurora-Borealis-Simulation

The simulation and parameters for producing the output were adjusted from the main.py.
The python script produces .POV type files, which can be rendered in POV-RAY to produce a .png file.

However, quite a lot of computational power is needed for these simulation in the case of a high number of particles beieng simulated, hence
the videos and pictures were produced using the high performance computing cluster from Imperial College London, where most oftenly 48 cores and 124 GB of RAM were used to produce an ouptuted image.

However, an image with smaller number of particles can be produced fairly quickly otherwise, i.e in half an hour.
